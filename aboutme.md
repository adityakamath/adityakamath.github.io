Hi there, I'm Aditya.

I'm a robotics/embedded systems engineer based in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I moved to Eindhoven from India in 2015, and its been home ever since. I spent the next four years at Eindhoven University of Technology, first pursuing a Masters degree in Control Systems, and then an Engineering Doctorate in Mechatronic Systems Design. Since graduating in late 2019, I've been working as an engineering consultant, working on the embedded systems/software of complex machines like [this one at ASML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6nCmG-PpI). In my spare time, I also build and program robots, [like AKROS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU5ga8xqMbQ).

During the lockdown in 2020, I started building a ROS based robot using rapid prototyping tools available at work, and this turned into a hobby where I've not only been able to sharpen some of my robotics skills from university and prior work experiences, but also learn quite a lot more. I found myself looking for a place to log my experiences, and that's how this website was born.

Other than a personal (but public) build journal, I also intend to use this website as a portfolio of my projects, at least the ones related to robotics, and the ones I can talk about in detail. This is also intended for potential collaborators, recruiters and investors. I'm always open to new opportunities, and definitely open to questions. If you want to have a chat, hit me up, my contact details are in the links at the bottom of the page.

Happy exploring!

\- Aditya
