I am Aditya Kamath, an Embedded/Robotics Systems Engineer based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I have a varied academic background ranging from a Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology in India, and then a Master in Systems and Control from TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Later in 2019, I also graduated with a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) in Mechatronic Systems Design from the same university.

While I have studied a lot of different things, the common denominator in my education has always been the field of autonomous robotics and I have been fortunate enough to work with multiple robotic systems throughout my education and extra-curricular experience.

I currently work as an Embedded Systems Consultant/Engineer at an engineering R&D company in Eindhoven. While my job involves designing embedded software for complex machines/mechatronic components, I do keep my passion for robotics alive by building robotic projects in my spare time. It isn't always a robotics build since I also love tinkering around with basic electronics, digital and analog sensors, microcontrollers/single-board computers, 3D printing and other rapid prototyping tools.

This website is an attempt to document my experiences, results and learnings. Its mostly meant as a journal for myself as well as a portfolio for future collaborators aND recruiters, but if you find something interesting and want to know more, do get in touch.

The quickest way to do it would probably be email or a message on LinkedIn. You can also contact me via Instagram. Here, you can check out my photography, travel experiences, music that I like and other absolutely random things. I also post updates about my robot builds on my stories. All the links are at the bottom of this page.

Happy exploring!
