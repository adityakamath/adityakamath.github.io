Hi there, welcome to my website!

I am Aditya Kamath, an Robotic/Embedded Systems Engineer from India, currently based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I currently work as an Embedded Systems Consultant at an engineering R&D company in Eindhoven. While my job involves designing embedded software for complex machines and mechatronic components, I do keep my passion for robotics and DIY alive by building hardware projects in my spare time. 

I started this website/blog in an attempt to document my experiences, results and learnings while building these side projects. While this is mostly meant as a journal for myself, it is also a portfolio for future collaborators/recruiters. If you want to get in touch for advice, job offers or just to say hi, the quicket way is by email or Twitter. The links are at the bottom of the page.

Happy exploring!

\- Aditya
