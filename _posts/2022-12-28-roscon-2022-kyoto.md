2022 was an incredible year, mostly thanks to my very first trip to Japan and my very first [ROSCon](https://roscon.ros.org/2022/). ROSCon, if you are new to the Robot Operating System is the annual [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) conference, gathering of roboticists, developers, researchers, and hobbyists for lectures, workshops and other events. ROSCon 2022 was extra special, as the ROS community was able to meet each other after two years of virtual ROSCon events.

As a bonus, the conference was organized in Kyoto, Japan. I've always wanted to visit Japan ever since I was introduced to Japanese food here in the Netherlands. Japan had also just opened up its borders for tourism, so there were hardly any tourists or crowds there (an absolute dream for photographers and enthusiasts like me). In this post, I'll talk about the conference itself, and also link some of my favorite talks (All the talks were recorded, and the recordings can be found on the [Open Robotics Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9954564). The slides from these talks can be found [here](http://download.ros.org/downloads/roscon/2022/)). For my experiences outside of the conference, including photo walks and trips to different places, I've already talked about it on [my Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/kamathsblog/), so make sure you check that out as well.
