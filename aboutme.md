Hi there, welcome to my website!

I am Aditya Kamath, an engineer from India but living in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. After a Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering from India, I first came to Eindhoven in 2015 to pursue a Master in Systems and Control. After I graduated in 2017, I decided to pursue a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) in Mechatronic Systems Design. The common denominator between my varied academic background has always been the field of robotics and I have been fortunate enough to work with multiple robotic systems throughout my education and extra-curricular experience.

I currently work as an Embedded Systems Consultant/Engineer at an engineering consulting company in Eindhoven. While my job involves designing embedded software for machines/mechatronic components, I do keep my passion for robotics alive by building robotic projects in my spare time. This website is an attempt to document my experiences, results and learnings. Its mostly meant as a journal for myself as well as a portfolio for future collaborators/recruiters, but if you find something interesting and want to know more, do get in touch.

The quickest way to do it would probably be email or a message on LinkedIn. You can also contact me via Instagram. Here, you can check out my photography, travel experiences, music that I like and other absolutely random things. I also post updates about my robot builds on my stories. All the links are at the bottom of this page. 

Happy exploring!

\- Aditya
