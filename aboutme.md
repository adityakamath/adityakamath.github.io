Hi there, welcome to my website!

I'm Aditya, roboticist/engineering consultant from India, now living and working in the Netherlands. I moved to the city of Eindhoven from Mumbai in 2015, and its been home ever since. I spent the next four years at Eindhoven University of Technology, first pursuing a masters degree in Systems and Control, and then a doctorate in engineering in the field of Mechatronics Systems Design. Since graduating TU Eindhoven in late 2019, I've been working as an engineering consultant in the field of embedded software for high-tech mechatronic systems - like [this photolithography machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6nCmG-PpI) for example. 

While my current work is quite similar to working with mobile robots, I soon realized its not quite the same. While building and programming robots, I really enjoy wearing multiple hats - mechanical engineer, electronics engineer, developer, architect. But the machines I work with these days are much bigger and usually in a cleanroom or factory environment - so every engineer has a specific role, and most dont even get to interact with the actual hardware. Since I enjoy DIY and making, I decided to build myself an autonomous robot in my spare time, and also learn new things along the way. 

I tried this two times since 2018, but it never got anywhere. The actual spark that lit the fire was the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. My team at work was one of the last to start working from home, so for a month, I worked from an office with multiple 3D printers, a laser cutter but with nobody to use it. I found my old RC car from a previous project, a Jetson Nano and decided to put them together. I had worked with the ROS framework, so I thought I would use that. In order to keep myself inspired, I decided to make this website and document my experiences, results and learnings. 

Since then, I've really started enjoying the process of designing and building a robot and plan on continuing to do more projects related to my fields of interest - 2D/3D perception, autonomous navigation, motion control, complex high-level behaviors, and multi-robot systems. Like the name of the blog suggests, I want to build *fully* autonomous (Level 5) robots. This, hopefully, will all be documented in here. Let's see how far this goes. 

While this website is mostly meant as a journal for myself, it is also a portfolio for future collaborators/recruiters. If you want to get in touch for advice/collaborations, job offers or just to say hi, the quicket way is by email or Twitter. The links are at the bottom of the page.

Happy exploring!
