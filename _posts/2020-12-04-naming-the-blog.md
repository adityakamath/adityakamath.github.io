Although its still my Instagram handle, it was time to move on to a more original name for this blog. So, after a great deal of thought, Kamath's Blog is now Sense.Think.Act -  named after the robotics paradigm that is also applicable for various other aspects of life. Its particularly apt for this robotics related blog as Sense (or Perception), Think (or Intelligence) and Act (or Motion Control/Actuation) are the three fundamental building blocks for any autonomous robot. Moreover, it also represents my three areas of interest and specialization from my academic and professional experiences. Finally, the new name also signifies a new chapter for this blog, as I move on to bigger and better projects starting from 2021.  

For the final month of 2020, I am currently at the final stages of the Jetracer2/Jetbot2 project and I expect to finish (software, documentation and demo) by Christmas. Meanwhile I am also working on finishing the rest of this website so that I can officialy share it with my professional network. Soon afer that, I also plan on applying for the Jetson AI Specialist certification from NVidia's Deep Learning Institute, before enjoying a well-deserved week off. 

For the new year, I have the following goals:

* Build and program a ROS2 robot (with multiple sensors - odometry, stereo vision, a 2D LiDAR, an IMU and GPS). I also plan on implementing advanced behavioral features using the ROS2 navigation stack (Nav2)
* Design, fabricate and solder my first PCB for the ROS2 robot - maybe in the form of a HAT or pHAT for the Raspberry Pi 4. 

As to whether I achieve these goals, only time will tell. For now, back to finishing the Jetbot2:
