### Autonomous Drone Referee
#### 2018 | Tech United, Eindhoven University of Technology

### AGV Localization in Changing Indoor Environments
#### 2016/2017 | Prodrive Technologies, TU Eindhoven
For my Master Thesis, worked with Prodrive Technologies to study and improve the their current AGV localization strategy for their next generation of autonomous 2D LiDAR based robots. Two strategies were proposed and both these strategies were implemented, and integrated in a simulated environment using ROS and Gazebo. This provided significant reduction in localization failures compared to the original approach. Project resources are not open-access.

### Self Driving Solar Robot
#### 2016 | TU Eindhoven
Programmed a self driving robot car powered using a solar panel to detect lanes using Hough Transforms and also detect traffic signs using Haar Cascade Classifiers. These functionalities were built using OpenCV and used to drive the robot along a simulated race track in the TU Eindhoven campus. As an additional project, the team of 3 also built a teleop mode using the internal IMU of a smartphone. Unfortunately, documentation is not freely accessible. 

### Maze Solving Robot
#### 2016 | TU Eindhoven
Programmed a ROS-based holonomic robot platform to complete a maze using only 2D LiDAR data. Used the pledge algorithm to solve simulated and physical mazes with 90 degree turns and open spaces. The robot was also programmed to detect doors and ring a doorbell. The 3-member team participated in two challenges with the other teams, and consistently ranked second, thus winning a crate of (well-deserved) beer! Our work is documented !here! and source code is available !here!

### Autonomous Navigation for a Lunar Excavator Robot
#### 2013/2014 | MIT Manipal

### NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition 2013
#### 2012/2013 | RoboManipal, MIT Manipal
Built and programmed the motor driver electronics of a 4 wheel differential drive excavator robot with features such as status indicators and an emergency button. Designed and developed a teleop GUI to control this motor controller over a wireless LAN connection. The team participated in the 4th NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA, and ranked 19th from 50 teams. Find more !here!

### ABU Robocon 2012
#### 2011/2012 | RoboManipal, MIT Manipal
Built the electronics and programmed the electronics for an autonomous grid following robot. The robot was also programmed to grab an object and place it autonomously at a pre-defined location. Used Arduinos, self-designed IR based color-sensor arrays and self-designed relay boards. The team participated in the ABU Robocon 2012 Nationals in Pune, India. More information !here!
