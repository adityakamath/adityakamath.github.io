2022 was an incredible year, mostly thanks to my very first trip to Japan and my very first [ROSCon](https://roscon.ros.org/2022/). ROSCon, if you are new to the Robot Operating System is the annual [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) conference, gathering of roboticists, developers, researchers, and hobbyists for lectures, workshops and other events. ROSCon 2022 was extra special, as the ROS community was able to meet each other after two years of virtual ROSCon events.

As a bonus, the conference was organized in Kyoto, Japan. I've always wanted to visit Japan ever since I was introduced to Japanese food here in the Netherlands. Japan had also just opened up its borders for tourism, so there were hardly any tourists or crowds there (an absolute dream for photographers and enthusiasts like me). In this post, I'll talk about the conference itself, and also link some of my favorite talks (All the talks were recorded, and the recordings can be found on the [Open Robotics Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9954564). The slides from these talks can be found [here](http://download.ros.org/downloads/roscon/2022/)). For my experiences outside of the conference, including photo walks and trips to different places, I've already talked about it on [my Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/kamathsblog/), so make sure you check that out as well.

## 19th October: Workshops

I started the day with a coffee at perhaps one of the best [Starbucks](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Starbucks+Coffee+-+Kyoto+Karasuma-Rokkaku/@35.00758,135.7586584,18z/data=!3m1!5s0x60010885325b0c1d:0x73b2527a8e8758c0!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sStarbucks!3m5!1s0x60010885331bf779:0x16d8674e3a571648!8m2!3d35.0075801!4d135.7597954!15sCglTdGFyYnVja3MiA4gBAVoLIglzdGFyYnVja3OSAQtjb2ZmZWVfc2hvcOABAA) I have ever been to. I found it accidentally, after walking into a [beautiful temple](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ch%C5%8Dh%C5%8D-ji+\(Rokkaku-d%C5%8D\)+Temple/@35.00746,135.7598936,19.67z/data=!3m1!5s0x60010885325b0c1d:0x73b2527a8e8758c0!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x60010885331bf779:0x16d8674e3a571648!2sStarbucks+Coffee+-+Kyoto+Karasuma-Rokkaku!8m2!3d35.0075801!4d135.7597954!3m4!1s0x0:0xc55a4b35e90756c8!8m2!3d35.0077132!4d135.7602563) on my way to the subway station. Right next to it was the coffee shop, with massive windows overlooking this temple. After the coffee, I took the subway to the conference venue.

Day 0 of the conference was reserved for full-day workshops, and participants had a choice between four workshops. But before talking about the workshops, I cannot miss talking about the stunning conference venue - the [Kyoto International Conference Center](https://www.icckyoto.or.jp/en/), a massive brutalist structure in the middle of green hills and woods, which were slowly turning yellow/red at the start of autumn. My favorite part of the venue was certainly the pond, with swans, turtles basking in the sun, and some beautifully colored Koi swimming around. We hung out a lot there, during lunch and breaks...

There were four workshop choices - [ROS 2 Control](https://control.ros.org/master/index.html), [Open-RMF](https://www.open-rmf.org/), A hands-on session with the [Mini Pupper](https://minipupperdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and finally a day of talks at [ROSConJP](https://roscon.jp/). As a former control engineering student, and with a few control systems related projects in mind, I chose to attend the [ros2_control](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control) workshop. ros2_control is an open-source control framework for real-time control of robots using [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html). It allows users to define their own control architectures and provides the building blocks to do so, including some implementations of commonly used control-theory concepts.

We spent the entire day on a completely hands-on workshop, setting up the URDF for a simple robot, defining the controllers and hardware interfaces, and eventually simulating the project (Thanks to [The Construct's ROS Development Studio](https://www.theconstructsim.com/the-ros-development-studio-by-the-construct/)). Finally, we were shown a real-life demo of ros2_control running on a robot dog somewhere in Barcelona over a wireless interface set up by [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/). A very useful workshop and I'm definitely looking forward to using these concepts in the near future. The workshop material is open source and well documented, it can be found [here](https://github.com/ros-controls/roscon2022_workshop).

## 20th October: ROSCon Day 1

Unlike the previous day of workshops, where only about 250 people participated, Day 1 had at least three times as many people. To accommodate them, the lectures were organized in much larger auditoriums as compared to the previous day. But first, I had to walk through the [exhibition area](https://roscon.ros.org/2022/img/ROSCon2022ExhibitHallFloorPlan.pdf), where robotics companies (most of them [ROSCon sponsors](https://roscon.ros.org/2022/#sponsors)) had set up their booths, and some of them even came with real robots that were just driving/walking about, showing off their skills.

First, I decided to spend some time listening to the [opening remarks](https://vimeo.com/769571056), and some of the plenary talks. One of the interesting talks in this session was by researchers from TU Dresden in Germany, who gave a talk about a ROS-based image-guided navigation system for minimally invasive liver surgery. It was a fascinating talk, as I had never really known of other ROS-based surgical applications. While this seemed like an innovative application, I was still apprehensive about its use on real humans, as ROS does not come with any safety certifications. Fortunately, this is just a research project for now, and from talking with the developers, they certainly had compliances and certifications in mind down the line. I think projects like this will force ROS developers to think about certifying their software for surgical applications, just like what [Space-ROS](https://www.therobotreport.com/open-robotics-developing-space-ros/) is trying to do for space applications.

After sitting through a couple more talks, I headed to the exhibition area to talk to the different robotics companies, and also get some stickers for my bare laptop. It was an amazing experience meeting people I had known from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kamathsblog) and [ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/) for the very first time, and seeing some robots that I had only worked on simulation with, in real life.

I also learned a lot about the newest robots, tools, and technologies these companies were exhibiting and got a chance to even drive some of the robots on display. Next, it was time for lunch, where we were provided with an amazing bento box (I accidentally picked the vegetarian option, but it was still delicious), which we took outside to eat by the pond.
