I started my engineering journey in high-school when I learnt to make a hovercraft in an after-school program. Soon after, I decided to study engineering in college. Since then, I've worked on multiple projects for universities (both MIT Manipal and TU Eindhoven), for industry clients (in the Netherlands) and also for myself as side projects. Here are some of my major projects, listed from last to first. 

### AKROS Platform - Jetracer2, Jetbot2
#### 2020 | Personal Project in Lockdown

During the Covid-19 lockdown, designed and implemented a ROS1 based system for Computer Vision and AI applications. Implemented the design on two robot platforms - Jetracer2 (ackermann-steered, based on NVidia Jetracer with custom add-ons), and Jetbot2 (differential-drive, based on NVidia Jetbot with add-ons).

PDEng Design Project: Designed, developed and integrated a functional prototype for demonstration of 5G in Robotics. On an experimental setup using Tech United's TURTLE platform and BlueSPACE's mm-Wave setup, I validated that over a 5G network, a distributed robotic/motion control system can be operated at 1kHz while maintaining its real-time properties.

### Multi-Drone Positioning and Formation Flying
#### 2018 | European Space Agency (ESTEC), TU Eindhoven

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://adityakamath.github.com/assets/img/formation_flying.png" />
</figure>

With a team of 12, designed a multi-quadrotor demonstrator to simulate a multi-satellite space mission by ESA for the ESA ESTEC Open Day 2018. As software architect and lead designer, implemented the multi-camera positioning system to localize the drones in 6dof for accurate trajectory following and control.

### Autonomous Drone Referee
#### 2018 | Tech United, Eindhoven University of Technology

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://adityakamath.github.com/assets/img/drone_referee.png" />
</figure>

In a team of 7, designed and implemented an autonomous drone concept to referee RoboSoccer matches. The drone was programmed to track a calculated "bubble of active play" and provide recommendations based on the status of the ball (goal, throw in) and the tracked players (collisions, fouls). This was demonstrated on Tech United's RoboCup field. [[1]](http://cstwiki.wtb.tue.nl/index.php?title=Drone_Referee_-_MSD_2017/18)

### AGV Localization in Changing Indoor Environments
#### 2016/2017 | Prodrive Technologies, TU Eindhoven

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://adityakamath.github.com/assets/img/master_thesis.png" />
</figure>

Master Thesis: Worked with Prodrive Technologies to study and improve their current AGV localization strategy for their next generation of autonomous 2D LiDAR based robots. Two strategies were proposed, implemented, and validated in a simulated environment using ROS and Gazebo. This project is not open-access.

### Self Driving Solar Robot
#### 2016 | TU Eindhoven

	<img align="right" width="200" height="200" padding-right="10" src="https://adityakamath.github.com/assets/img/embedded_visual_control.png" />
</figure>

As a part of a course, programmed a self driving solar powered robot to detect/follow lanes and traffic signs using OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi. This was demonstrated on a track built on the TU Eindhoven campus. As an additional project, the team of 3 also built a teleop mode using the internal IMU of a smartphone.

### Maze Solving Robot
#### 2016 | TU Eindhoven

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://adityakamath.github.com/assets/img/embedded_motion_control.png" />
</figure>

Programmed a ROS-based holonomic robot platform to complete a maze using only 2D LiDAR data. Used the pledge algorithm to solve simulated and physical mazes with 90 degree turns and open spaces. The 3-member team participated in two challenges during the course, and ranked second, thus winning a crate of (well-deserved) beer!

### Autonomous Navigation of a Lunar Robot
#### 2013/2014 | MIT Manipal

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://adityakamath.github.com/assets/img/bachelor_thesis.png" />
</figure>

Bachelor's Thesis: Designed and simulated a complete autonomy strategy for the lunar excavator robot built by RoboManipal in 2012-2013. This involved a study and implementation of robot perception, trajectory planning and finally motion control to complete the NASA Lunabotics Mining Challenge problem statement autonomously.

As Team Lead and System Engineer, I designed and implemented the electronics, communications and control software for a differential drive lunar excavator robot teleoperated over a high-latency wireless network. The 12-member team participated in the 4th NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA, and ranked 19th from 50 teams.

### ABU Robocon 2012
#### 2011/2012 | RoboManipal, MIT Manipal

<figure class="aligncenter">

</figure>

Built and programmed the electronics (IR sensor arrays, relay boards, Arduinos) for an autonomous grid following robot and a manually operate mobile robot. The autonomous robot was programmed to navigate on a grid, grab an object and place it autonomously at a pre-defined location. The team participated in the ABU Robocon 2012 in Pune, India.
