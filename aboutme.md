Hi there, welcome to my website!

I'm a generalist design engineer from India, currently living in the Netherlands after gaining a graduate degree and a professional doctorate in engineering from Eindhoven University of Technology. I currently living in Eindhoven and work as an Embedded Systems Consultant at a global engineering R&D company in the city. While my job involves designing embedded software for complex machines and mechatronic components, I do keep my passion for mobile robotics and DIY alive by building hardware projects in my spare time. 

I started this website/blog in an attempt to document my experiences, results and learnings while building my lockdown robotics project in 2020. Since then, I've started enjoying the process of designing and building a robot and plan on continuing to do more projects related to my fields of interest- 2D/3D perception, localization, path-planning/navigation, complex high-level behaviors, and multi-robot systems. This, hopefully, will all be documented in my blog. Let's see how far this goes. 

While this website is mostly meant as a journal for myself, it is also a portfolio for future collaborators/recruiters. If you want to get in touch for advice/collaborations, job offers or just to say hi, the quicket way is by email or Twitter. The links are at the bottom of the page.

Happy exploring!

\- Aditya
