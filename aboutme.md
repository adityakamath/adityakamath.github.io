Hi there, welcome to my website!

I am Aditya Kamath, an Embedded/Robotics Systems Engineer based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I currently work as an Embedded Systems Consultant at an engineering R&D company in Eindhoven. While my job involves designing embedded software for complex machines and mechatronic components, I do keep my passion for robotics and DIY alive by building projects in my spare time. It isn't always a robotics build since I also love tinkering around with basic electronics, digital and analog sensors, microcontrollers/single-board computers, 3D printing and other rapid prototyping tools.  

Between 2010 and 2019 (with a gap year in between), I spent my time between MIT Manipal in India, where I pursued a Bachelor in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and TU Eindhoven where I received a MSc in Systems and Control and then a PDEng in Mechatronic Systems Design. While I have studied a lot of different things, the common denominator in my education has always been the field of autonomous robotics and I have been fortunate enough to work with multiple robotic systems throughout my education and extra-curricular experience. 

This website is an attempt to log my experiences, results and learnings while building my side projects. While this is mostly meant as a journal for myself, it is also a portfolio for future collaborators and recruiters. So if you find something interesting and want to know more, do get in touch. The quickest way to do it would probably be email or Twitter. You can also contact me via Instagram. Here, you can check out my photography, travel experiences, music that I like and other absolutely random things. I also regularly post updates on my builds on Instagram Stories. All the links are at the bottom of this page. 

Happy exploring!

\- Aditya
