## 21st October: ROSCon Day 2

On Day 2, I decided to skip a few of the morning sessions (I was aware of the contents of many of them, and as mentioned before, the [slides](http://download.ros.org/downloads/roscon/2022/) and [videos](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9954564) were going to be made available later). As I had a limited time in Kyoto, I decided to go on an early morning walk around the landmark historic areas of the city and click some photographs. I first went to [Kiyomizu-Dera](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkSkUm7qW9E/), walked down the beautiful [Ninenzaka](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkVmTNmqrxB/) street, and spent some time around the [Hokan-ji](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkbhfrAKTXI/) temple. Finally, I walked down to the [Gion area and Yasaka shrine](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkdvjqgKTXI/) as the shops were starting to open up, and I went to the [Nishiki market](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkgOE4SKNwr/) for some food and souvenir shopping.

I eventually headed back to the Kyoto International Conference Center to grab some lunch by the lake where we were surprised by [Formant's robot dog](https://formant.io/news-and-blog/2022/10/26/events/4-highlights-from-roscon-2022/) once again, who came by to show off some moves.

Finally, after lunch, it was time to attend the track that I had been waiting eagerly for - the Navigation track. The first highlight for me was the talk about migrating from ROS 1 to ROS 2 by [Fetch Robotics](https://fetchrobotics.com/). This wasn't something entirely new for me, but the talk validated my own strategy for moving my robots from ROS 1 to ROS 2 - by migrating node by node and using [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge) so that ROS 1 and ROS 2 nodes worked together. However, this method has a few drawbacks, especially for complex node graphs, so the talk also focused on topic-by-topic migration and its advantages over node-by-node migration. This allows for incremental progress with very low overhead.

Next, Steve Macenski, the lead developer of Nav2 talked about the use of [Smac planners](https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-smac-planner.html), a plugin that provides [multiple A* based path planner implementations](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_smac_planner) for use with Nav2 on ROS 2. Steve talked about the different implementations and how they work, along with how to configure them on Nav2, and examples of these methods being used in the field.

The final highlight of the Navigation track, and also the talk I was most eager for, was the talk by [Davide Faconti](https://twitter.com/facontidavide) about version 4 of his [BehaviorTree.cpp](https://www.behaviortree.dev/) (BT) project, updates in this version, and the roadmap for the future. This was probably the most fun talk, as Davide included memes and jokes throughout. All this while explaining the most important updates of BT 4.0 - like the ability to add simple scripts, standardized pre and post-conditions, and states. The latter especially put an end to the Behavior Trees vs State Machines debate, by reaching a common ground.

After a little break, where we were provided some delicious Japanese snacks and sweets, I headed to the Hardware track - another set of talks that I was eagerly waiting for. First, the talk by Avi Brown about [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) with ROS 2 and [micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/). He introduced Edge Impulse - which is a platform for developing machine learning models for low-memory devices such as microcontrollers, and gave a few insights into his side projects using this platform, especially with micro-ROS and devices such as the [RPi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), and the [Arduino Portenta](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/portenta-h7).

Finally, the last talk of the track, and also of the conference - a talk about a [Raspberry Pi image with ROS2 Humble and a real-time kernel](https://github.com/ros-realtime/ros-realtime-rpi4-image). [Shuhao Wu](https://shuhaowu.com/), a freelance robotics consultant, talked about his Raspberry Pi image, which had been tuned specifically to run real-time applications with ROS 2, and how he implemented this. He also talked about the need for such an image, the challenges he faced along the way, and took us through some benchmarking results.

### Closing remarks

ROSCon 2022 ended with closing remarks by the ROSCon organizers. They told us about the amazing organizing team, gave us stats about the attendees and where they came from, and ended with a few announcements. The first was the open-source release of the PR2 robot's hardware design archive. The [PR2](https://robots.ieee.org/robots/pr2/) is one of the first robots with ROS installed and was sold to labs and universities around the world. Eventually, the software was released as a standalone framework for other robots to use. According to Open Robotics, which has been compiling and documenting all the design resources related to this robot, the archive will be open-sourced early next year.

Next, it was time to announce the location of ROSCon 2023. ROSCon 2020 and 2021 were both canceled due to the pandemic and were supposed to be held in New Orleans in the USA. So, it wasn't surprising when they announced [New Orleans as the venue for ROSCon 2023](https://10times.com/e1zp-zf3g-9d39).

## Plans for the future

My first ROSCon was certainly a special experience, as I finally got to meet a lot of people I look up to in the field of robotics, people who have inspired me on my experiences with ROS, and others whom I'd only known via social media interactions. I also learned a lot and came back with a massive list of ideas for future projects. For 2023 especially, I plan on focusing on migrating my robots to [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases/Release-Humble-Hawksbill.html) and then focusing on the following frameworks:

* [ros2_control](https://control.ros.org/master/index.html)
* [Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/)
* [BehaviorTree.cpp 4.0](https://www.behaviortree.dev/)
* [micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/) (with [Edge Impulse](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/experts/machine-learning-prototype-projects/ros2-part1-pubsub-node))
* [Unity Engine](https://blog.unity.com/manufacturing/advance-your-robot-autonomy-with-ros-2-and-unity)

I also want to explore MDE/[MBSE](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/introduction-model-based-systems-engineering-mbse/) techniques and see how I can apply them while working with robots and ROS. As I said earlier, this significantly reduces the barrier to entry for non-software engineers to get started with ROS, especially researchers who are working with the electrical and mechanical engineering aspects of robotics.

The top highlight of ROSCon 2022, for me, has to be its location, the beautiful city of Kyoto in Japan. Japan has always been at the top of my bucket list and I was so stoked to be there for the very first time. As Japan was just opening its borders to tourists, there were hardly any of them there (which resulted in some amazing photos without any crowds, which can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/kamathsblog/)). This meant that I could see the real Japan, interact with locals and delve into the culture there. And I cannot forget the food, which were some of the best meals I've had in my life.

Unfortunately, due to the pandemic rules in Japan, my company had strict policies and did not allow me to extend my trip and have a small holiday there. This meant that I did not get a chance to get out of Kyoto, but I plan on (hopefully) changing this in 2023 with another trip to Japan. This time, I want to start from Tokyo, and visit other cities like Yokohama, and places like Mount Fuji.

To conclude, my very first ROSCon was an absolutely unbelievable experience, mostly thanks to the people (especially the organizing team at [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org/) for an excellent conference), the location, and the food. I learned a lot, met old friends, and made new ones. I also realized that I still have a lot to learn and grow as a software engineer in the field of Robotics. But there's an entire new year for that. I hope 2023 is just as exciting as 2022 (if not more), and that I get a chance to achieve some of the goals I mentioned above. If all goes according to plan, I hope to see a lot of you (including my new ROSCon friends) at ICRA 2023 in London...
